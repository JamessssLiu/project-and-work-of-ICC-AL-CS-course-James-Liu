First input a 2D array that does not conclude value over 255, and the precentage of the rise of brightness of every pixel
then use iteration procedures to increase every value in the array by n%.
if the brightness of the pixel exeeds the limit, assign the acquiescent maximum value---255 to the pixel.
Output the result.
